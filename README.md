# EXP

EXP is a simple productivity app for Android to keep track of expenses. The app will offer intuitive ways to manage amounts, set budgets, separate expenses in categories and have monthly summaries.

## Features

Refer to the [board](https://github.com/rovati/exp-app/projects/1) for a complete insight on the development.

### Planned

The project has just kicked off, but many features are already planned for the following weeks:

- Access a global summary of expense amounts and set a global monthly budget
- Keep track of previous months summaries
- Create and manage various categories for expenses
- Access each category to have a local summary of amounts and budgets
- Add expense entries specifying a name and a date in addition to the expense amount

Moreover, one of the main goals of the app is to have a modern UI achieved through simple yet effective design principles.

### Currently Under Development

The alpha version includes basic features for adding and removing entries to a single centralized list. Moving on to a beta version the goal is to include the system to create multiple lists and set budgets for each of them.
